Minecraft is great fun, but did you know that you can link the Minecraft world to the real world?
No I don't mean that creepers will try and get you in the night, I mean that you can do lots of great things using components in the real world that affect the Minecraft world.

What we will do is create a simple introduction to doing this, using an add on board for your Raspberry Pi

##Pibrella

Pibrella is a board designed and made by two companines ![Cyntech}(http://www.cyntech.co.uk/) and ![Pimoroni](http://pimoroni.com/)
