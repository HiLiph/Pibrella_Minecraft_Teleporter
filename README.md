Minecraft is great fun, but did you know that you can link the Minecraft world to the real world?
No I don't mean that creepers will try and get you in the night, I mean that you can do lots of great things using components in the real world that affect the Minecraft world.

What we will do is create a simple introduction to doing this, using an add on board for your Raspberry Pi

##Pibrella

Pibrella is a board designed and made by two companines [Cyntech](http://www.cyntech.co.uk/) and [Pimoroni](http://pimoroni.com/) and it enables anyone to use electronics safely with their Raspberry Pi.
The board retails for around Â£10 and is well worth the money.

###Install your Pibrella

The Pibrella is designed to work with all models of Raspberry Pi.

**NEVER unplug or plug an add on board from a Raspberry Pi while it is turned on. It will cause damage. Always ensure the power is off**

####For Model A and B
The Pibrella will fit over all of the GPIO pins and will be flush with the Raspberry Pi.

####For Model A+ and B+
The Pibrella will fit over the first 26 pins, where pin 1 is the pin nearest to the micro SD card slot.
